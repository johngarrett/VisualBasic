# VisualBasic
I made these programs freshman year. 
There were tons I made in visual baisc but these were the only ones I decided to save.

- OmniProg was supossed to become an OS one day, ha.
- PiggyBank was me showing off everything I could do with design.
    - I rememeber being so frustrated at visual studio's limitations
- TicTacToe was a required program (as was PiggyBank) but I was proud of the design
    - I think the logic is still messed up in this.
#### UPDATE: Found the other programs collecting dust on my google drive
