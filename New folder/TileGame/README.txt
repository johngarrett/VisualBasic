The RES folder is required to get the game running. Since canvas only lets me upload files and not folders,
you will have to add all the .png files into a folder called textures within a folder called Res.
Secondly, you will have to put world1.txt into a folder called worlds within the same Res folder. 
Lastly, you will have to put the font file in a folder named fonts with the same super folder.
if this doesnt work, I've uploaded a zip file with everything in the right place named "FINAL PROJECT"

This game runs very poorly on my macbook pro (i think it has a problem with the threads?) but 
it runs flawlessly on my windows desktop and windows school computers... your mileage may vary

The world file format is:
	first two numbers are the width and height of the map
	the second two numbers are the x and y position
	the rest of the numbers chose which tiles to display

This program was developed using Eclipse but if you want to debug it in blueJ, you should
just be able to import the .java files.
